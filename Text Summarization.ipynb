    "In this notebook, we are going to examine NLP based text summarization. There are two different kinds of summarizations: Extractive and Abstractive. In extractive text summarization, no new text is generated; which means the algorithm picks and returns the \"key sentences\" in the given text, and form a summary using these sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in abstractive text summarization, the program understands the input text, and re-write a summary based on the input. This process also requires Natural Language Generation. \n",

    "It is clear that extractive methods are faster, and the quality of the output highly depends on the quality of the input text; While abstractive methods requires more computation (and higher hardware requirements), and depends more on the pre-trained model in terms of quality. \n",

Users access Twitter through its website interface, through Short Message Service (SMS) or its mobile-device application software (app). Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world. Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as the SMS of the Internet. As of 2018, Twitter had more than 321 million monthly active users.\"\n",
